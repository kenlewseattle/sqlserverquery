[SELECT | FROM | WHERE]

select * from sales.customers
where city = 'houston'



Source: http://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-select/

Analysis:
/* The classic SELECT statement selects FROM a schema ('sales'),
   while 'customers' is the table that is related to 'sales.'
   Therefore using FROM statement should have format like this
   [schema_name.table_name]

   WHERE statement can further specify the condition of the query 
   that it will further narrowing down the search. 
   WHERE statement along with HAVING, GROUP BY, ORDER BY,
   and others are SQL Clauses.

[WHERE | GROUP BY | ORDER BY]

SELECT

FROM

Analysis:
/* With ORDER BY, I can sort the table specified in an ascending 
   order. In this example, I have used 'customer_id' to be sorted.
   Noticed that 'customer_id' started with 20, which that is because
   the WHERE have a condition that 'customer_id' is at or more than 20.

[HAVING]

SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    customer_id
FROM
    sales.customers
WHERE
    customer_id BETWEEN 20 AND 30
GROUP BY
    first_name,
    last_name,
    customer_id
HAVING 
    customer_id >25	
ORDER BY
    customer_id

/* HAVING clause works with a condition and the condition in the
   example is 'customer_id' is more than 25. Even though I can specify
   than in the WHERE clause, however, this to shows that WHERE and HAVING
   can be in the same query.

[HAVING AND WHERE Comparison]

SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    customer_id,
    state
FROM
    sales.customers
WHERE
    zip_code >= 30000
GROUP BY
    first_name,
    last_name,
    customer_id,
    state
HAVING 
    customer_id >25	
ORDER BY
    state

Analysis:
/* WHERE clause can be based off on any column in the base table and 
   HAVING clause only can refer to the result of the SELECT statement 
   or the GROUP BY clause.
   To illustrate this concept, the WHERE clause is set to have condition
   of a 'zipcode' table that is or higher than 30000. Notice that zipcode
   are not part of the SELECT statement. Whereas HAVING is bound by the 
   SELECT and GROUP BY
