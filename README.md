# SQL SERVER QUERY

******SQL Server Research Project Repository******

This is my project/portfolio for SQL Server class 
at Saint Martin's University. Purpose of this research
project is to demostrate my understanding of SQL Server 2016
through actual queries and its output. My goal is to input queries 
that have combination of statements that would be beyond the basic 
fundamentals that I have learned either through class or through the
textbook.

This specific repository should have 50 queries along with it's output
and my feedback on understanding of the query. The sample database and examples that I am 
using are from the website http://www.sqlservertutorial.net

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any feedback regarding 
the queries or if it can be further improved! Also, I will have another repository 
that have comparison between SQL Server and SQLite on their capabilities and 
structure, coming soon!

On the below would be a sample of the structure that I will be consistently
using throughout the 50 queries.

--------------------------------------------------
Sample Structure:
[SELECT statement]

SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM
    sales.customers;

[Insert snippit image results here]

Source: http://www.sqlservertutorial.net

Analysis:
/* The query would select the first and last name
   of the customers from sales table */
